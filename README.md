# To-Do List Application with Python and Tkinter

This GitHub repository contains a simple yet functional To-Do List application built using Python and the Tkinter library for GUI development. The main purpose of this application is to help users manage their tasks in an organized manner. The application offers an intuitive user interface that enables users to easily add, delete, and mark tasks as done. The design is clean and user-friendly, making it suitable for personal task management.

1.Features:
The application provides the following features:

•Task Addition: Users can input new tasks into the application using the provided input field and then click the "ADD" button to add the task to the list.

•Task Deletion: Tasks that are no longer needed can be selected from the list and removed by clicking the "DELETE" button.

•Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as done by selecting them from the list and clicking the "DONE" button. This visually distinguishes completed tasks from ongoing ones.

•Task Persistence: The application ensures that tasks remain saved even after closing the program. Tasks are saved to a text file ("tasks.txt") and loaded back when the application is opened again.

2.User Interface:
The user interface is divided into two main sections:

The left frame contains controls for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as done. It includes an input field for task entry and buttons for task management.
The right frame displays the list of tasks. Each task is displayed in a Listbox, allowing users to easily identify tasks and interact with them.
3.Usage:
Users can interact with the application by entering tasks and using the provided buttons to manage tasks. The clean and straightforward design ensures a smooth experience, even for users new to the application.
